# Rubiks-Cube
A rudimentary rubiks cube solver
When the Python code executes, the cube’s state is randomized, the code solves the cube using trial and error through a common solution process called ”Layering.”
When the execution is complete, an animation appears showing all moves sequentially from the beginning-randomized state to its solved-segregated-colored state.
